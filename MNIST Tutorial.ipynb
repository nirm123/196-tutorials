    "\n",
    "MNIST is a dataset of handwritten digits. Below is the implementation of a relatively simple CNN that predicts the digit based on the image. The goals for this week are to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Continue researching project/assemble papers you find.\n",
    "2. Read through this notebook and try and gain an understanding. If you have any questions, message in the Discord.\n",
    "3. Create your own notebook and implement a CNN. Try different hyperparameters, architectures, optimizers and see how it impacts the accuracy. Experiment to get a better understanding of how things work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, if you have any questions, make sure to message the Discord chat and I will try to respond ASAP. I'm not sure if this is too much work for 1 week, so try to make as much progress as possible and bring your questions/comments to the next meeting. Also tell me if you think this is useful/worthless as I can do more/less of these. I'm hoping this will give everyone a basic understanding moving forward.\n",

We can then feed these 10 values to a softmax in order to calculate the probability the input image was a specfic digit."
